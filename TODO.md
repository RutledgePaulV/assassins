### Fronts
- Bugs
  - State dropdown can't be expanded via click, only a tab focus.


- UX
  - Game landing pages are ugly AF
  - "Settings" when creating a game don't make sense / aren't all necessary
  - Changing your profile image should immediately display in preview box before saving


- Features
  - Scheduled celery jobs should initiate games and send emails


- Tweaks
  - Title for game should restrict typing at 15+ characters
  - Users should be able to link a social account to their existing account


- Data
  - It would be nice to have "real" fake data


- Analytics
  - Finish defining events for heap


- Search
  - Whoosh seems a *little* slow.
