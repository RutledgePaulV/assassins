## For facilitating the group game 'Assassins'
[from wikipedia](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Assassin_(game))

Assassins (also Gotcha, KAOS (Killing as organized sport), 
Juggernaut, Battle Royal, Paranoia, Killer, Elimination, or Circle of Death) is a live-action game. 
Players try to eliminate each other from the game using mock weapons in an effort to become the last surviving player.

## What
It's a website! You can register a group, send out invitation links, customize the rules, decide when
the game should start and end, and send out notifications throughout. 

Kill assignments will be generated by the system and
dispatched to your players. As players are eliminated they can update the status, and any conflicted
calls will be left up to the administrator(s) of the game to resolve. 

Once a target is eliminated, the next target will be dispatched to the killer. I also plan to build 
in simple text message interaction until I get around to developing a mobile app too.

## Why
I played this game with a lot of friends in college several times. It was fun, disruptive, and a good way
to bring strangers together. However it turns out that organizing it can be a pain and no good solutions
exist yet.

## Can you help?
I'm sure you could. However I haven't taken the time to document set up and things like that to really enable a community yet.
